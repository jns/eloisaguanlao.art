	"about": "<p>“Exposition Universelle engages the audience as both the viewer and the viewed through a model nineteenth-century camera -- a common mode of appropriation and signifier of modernist thought.  Circling the work, we are presented with the purported view through the camera: a stereoview-like diptych.  We, as viewers, become the viewed while Guanlao confers agency upon the image created by the camera -- Guanlao herself dressed in traditional Hawaiian regalia -- by reversing the gaze.  Through references within the diptych, such as Pablo Picasso’s Guernica and Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, touristic/ethnographic fascination with Hawaii, and Guanlao’s own visual work, age-long issues of appropriation, colonialism, and the “exotic indigenous” rise to the surface and force viewers to consider not only the impact but also the verity of the camera and recorded history.”  By Elysia Poon, Art Historian</p>",

Another example is the disconnect between the “sale” via a funding proposal of a research project, such as nano technology, and the actual results in the lab.</p>",

The second tells the aspirations of a particular group of youth from surrounding New Mexico communities.  The third has adapted to the arid land of the western United States by growing wheels and traveling to various communities where I conducted a photography/performance/video workshop revolving around oceanic traditions.</p><p>The canoes are still my most successful project in eliciting a sense of wonder and engagement from total strangers.  They provided me the delightful opportunity to meet a variety of people who felt in tune with the work.  It reminded them of something they knew, but could not quite grasp. I enjoyed creating the three pieces.  The process was engaging both for me and the kids who participated in their creation.</p><p>This project was made possible by generous grants from UNM and with the big-hearted participation of the youth and staff of Isleta Pueblo Cultural Center, Barelas Community Center, Cesar Chavez Community Center, Singing Arrow Community Center, Del Aire Park Community Center, and the Pueblo of Isleta Elementary School.  Big mahalo to Adam Silva for painting one of the canoes.  Thank you.</p>",

I conducted a series of interventions at multiple business districts and work sites in Los Angeles and San Pedro.  Alongside other food trucks and vendors, I parked the “Free Water” truck, advertising fresh spring water for free.  Each customer was offered a field guide containing a map inside with directions to the sources of water for the Los Angeles basin.  I asked the following questions:<ul><li>Would you be willing to move somewhere where water is readily available?  </li><li>How much physical work are you willing to exert to collect water manually?</li><li>Which of your daily activities take up the most water usage?   </li><li>How much comfort are you willing to give up to obtain this water? </li></ul>The final exhibition combined a large-scale floor map charting the water sources and distribution net-works for Los Angeles, along with the tabulated responses from “Free Water” truck customers.   The map included the various fauna and flora that are impacted by the technological infrastructures that make water available to Los Angeles.  The viewer can trace both the water and my journey physically and metaphorically by walking on top of the map.</p>",

The canoes on stilt paddles serve as a double-edged reminder of the tenuous benefits and pitfalls of technological dependence and ecological alterations.

 "about": "<p><i>Holo Mai Pele</i> recounts the Hawai’ian deity Pele’s unrelenting search for a home.  Her difficult story of migration and fraught encounters is replayed with changing casts of characters through different times and places, such as in the occupation of the Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands during the first and second imperial world wars of the twentieth century or the colonization of the Philippines from the fifteenth to twentieth century.  <i>Holo Mai Pele</i> provides the stage-like platform where Pele’s journey becomes the allegory for the legacy of colonialist domination that persist to this day in very catastrophic outcomes—the loss of a way of life and home for island dwellers due to the rise of sea waters.  Pele’s voyage is the launching vehicle for <i>Talking Story</i>, a series of installations and documentary/performances that examine and question the historical archives of human migration, territorial expansion, and natural resource extraction in four continents over a span of five centuries, all entreating for environmental justice.    The series seeks to counter the disparity and community disruption that arise as groups cling or gain access to prime land and resources.  Environmental justice resists the us-versus-them colonialist mentality that regards the earth as real estate to possess, carve and subjugate.</p><p><i>Holo Mai Pele</i> considers the privileged North American position vis-à-vis unchecked climate change as either passive bystanders or as engaged participants.  I appropriate the material cultural form of the map as signifier of colonialist domination.  Mapping denotes ownership, a sweeping administrative overview of dominion and resources.  The surfboard-sized oars contain two maps.  On one side is a colonial-era map of disappeared or disappearing lakes and on the other side is a present-day topographic low relief maps of disappeared or disappearing islands.</p><p>Photos and video courtesy of Allys Palladino-Craig</p>",

 "about": "<p><i>Noli Me Tangere</i> is the tangled story of colonialism, immigration and survival in the form of a life-sized, cast paper <i>jeepney</i> and an accompanying documentary film.  Motivated by my search for original comic books that my father illustrated during my childhood in the Philippines, Noli Me Tangere is my journey into the colonial and immigration history of the Philippines.  It traces my own family’s experience within the larger story of Filipino immigration.</p><p><i>Noli Me Tangere</i> is a two-part project that takes place in the Philippine city of Manila.  The first segment is an installation-interaction comprised of a life-sized, cast paper <i>jeepney</i> covered with comic book pages designed by my father—traces of childhood memories of my father’s creativity and hard work left behind for better prospects abroad.  It is mounted on a wheeled bamboo raft to reference vivid childhood recollections of intense annual typhoon flooding.  The second component is a personal documentary film that examines forced and voluntary human migration as a legacy of colonization via my own family’s story of transplantation, which follows a larger historical progression of human capital flight from the Philippines.</p><p>The cast <i>jeepney</i> is the vehicle for drawing people into valuable conversations about history, society, and culture’s relationship to colonization and migration.  Acting as a traveling comic book stand, beckons local passersby to read its pages. The comic pages contain enduring tales of losing loved ones to immigration, reflecting their own lives.  Filipinos are all too familiar with immigration’s sacrifices and benefits and most are touched by it in some form or another.  A staggering ten percent to the Philippine GDP comes from remittances abroad.  I ask willing passersby to write names of their family members abroad in the interior of the <i>jeepney</i> and record their story on film.  The <i>jeepney</i>, a World War II American relic appropriated for popular public transportation, is a colorful and flashy banner of Filipino identify often graced by the protective figure of the Virgin Mother at the dashboard—herself an icon of Spanish colonial domination.  As such, the <i>jeepney</i> is an ideal icon to foster dialog precisely because it cuts through the sensitive and central themes of colonization, transportation, migration, and identity.</p><p>The Noli Me Tangere documentary traces the life of my father from his early days as a comic book artist in the Philippines to our family’s resettlement in the United States vis à vis the larger issue of Filipino emigration.  I am visiting the comic book houses that my father worked for in Manila and conducting interviews of family members and my father’s friends and colleagues. The project seeks to understand the motivation and consequences of Filipinos either choosing to remain and contribute to the cultural and socio-economic development of their birthplace, versus seeking their fortune elsewhere.</p><p>I have not returned to the Philippines since immigrating to the United States with my parents and siblings when I was nine years old.  My father’s passing has compelled me to return, not as a passive expatriate tourist, but as an active cultural worker who strives to understand and contribute to the enrichment of local Filipino society.  The quest to find original comic books that my father illustrated in the Philippines during the 1970s and 1980s runs parallel to my documentation of the enduring traces of the colonial past manifested in the sights and sounds of contemporary Filipino life, from Spanish Catholic-influenced movies and melodramatic comic book stories to World War II-era American jeep trucks turned public transportation <i>jeepneys</i>.</p><p>As an artist and ecologically-minded humanist I am interested in performing history and historiography through visual means, giving careful consideration to the materials I use.  <i>Noli Me Tangere</i> is an integral part of Talking Story, an intended multifaceted long-term project, spanning three continents and five centuries of territorial expansion and human movement, and containing the migration stories of people and their often fraught encounters as they struggle to construct their daily existence and shape the course of culture and history.</p><p>This project is made possible in part by an Artist Fellowship grant from SECAC, Southeastern College Art Conference.</p>",
